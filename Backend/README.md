## Frontend integration

Ensure CORS is configured to allow your frontend origin:

- Set `CLIENT_URLS` in `.env` as a comma-separated list, e.g.
  `CLIENT_URLS=http://localhost:3000,https://your-frontend.example.com`.
- The API base path is `/api`. Example endpoints:
  - `GET /health` (no auth)
  - `GET /api/status` (no auth)
  - `POST /api/auth/login`
  - `POST /api/auth/register`
  - `POST /api/auth/refresh` (cookie or body)
  - `GET /api/auth/profile` (requires Bearer token)

Note: Health endpoints are backed by Core infrastructure. Use `checkDatabaseHealth()` from `src/core/config/prisma.config.ts` for DB health and diagnostics.

JWT payload contains `tenantId`, `memberId`, `sessionId`, and role codes in `roles`.

# Enterprise Multi‚ÄëTenant ERP Platform

**Next-generation construction and project management ERP** with fraud-resistant architecture, immutable audit trails, and zero-loss inventory accountability. Built for construction contractors, project-based services, and enterprise compliance requirements.

## Executive Summary

This platform solves critical operational gaps in construction and project-based industries through **end-to-end financial traceability** (Estimate ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Invoice ‚Üí Payment), **digital accountability** (dual-signature inventory, approval workflows), and **enterprise compliance** (SOC2, GDPR, audit-first design). Unlike ServiceTitan, Jobber, or Buildertrend, our architecture prevents fraud, enforces custody chains, and maintains immutable business flow integrity at the database level.

## Core Business Flows

**Financial (Revenue)**: `Estimate ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Invoice ‚Üí Payment`

- 1:1:1 traceability with shared DocumentGroup numbering
- Change Orders provide controlled scope adjustments with delta tracking
- Restrict-level cascade protection prevents orphaned financial records

**Operational (Execution)**: `EstimateLineItem ‚Üí ProjectTask ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Schedule ‚Üí Timesheet ‚Üí Payroll`

- Estimate line items auto-generate project tasks with budget tracking
- Real-time cost monitoring feeds profitability dashboards
- Approval gates prevent payroll leakage

**Inventory Zero-Loss**: `InventoryItem ‚Üí Transaction (ASSIGN/TRANSFER/RETURN) ‚Üí Dual Signatures ‚Üí Audit Chain`

- Mandatory assignee + custodian signatures for all transfers
- Tamper-evident InventoryTransactionChain with distributed locking
- Loss investigations and return reminders for accountability

## Developer Quick Start

```bash
# Generate Prisma client

## Architecture Overview

**Hybrid Multi-Tenant Design**

- **Model Taxonomy**: Global (platform registries), Tenant (isolated data), Hybrid (tenant-scoped with globalId for federation)
- **One-Sided Architecture**: Relations reference `[tenantId, id]` without back-loops to Tenant table
- **RLS Enforcement**: Row-Level Security via tenantId on all BT/BH models with composite FK patterns

**Audit-First Schema**

- **Lifecycle Fields**: status, version (OCC), createdAt/updatedAt, soft-delete (deletedAt), actor attribution

**Financial Integrity**

- **Restrict Cascades**: Estimate ‚Üí Project ‚Üí Invoice protected from accidental deletion
- **Shared Numbering**: DocumentGroup + NumberSequence ensure consistent external references
- **Performance**: BRIN indexes on time-series, composite indexes on hot paths (status, FKs, amounts)

  - `projects.module.md` (Projects/Operations)
  - `documentation/changeOrder/changeOrderModule.md` (Change Orders)
  - `estimatingsales.md` (Estimating Prisma models)
- Prisma schema location: `prisma/schema.prisma`. Generated client: `generated/prisma/*`.
- Common commands (optional):
  - Generate client: `npx prisma generate`
  - Validate schema: `npx prisma validate`
  - Studio: `npx prisma studio`

## Appendix ‚Äî DataModels.md Audit Summary

Scope: Validate naming, module separation, Global/Tenant/Hybrid classifications, lifecycle/audit patterns, and cross‚Äëmodule relationships.

Highlights (Pass):

- Clear module boundaries with counts; consistent use of [Global], [Tenant], [Hybrid] annotations.
- Financial flow modules (Estimating, Projects, Billing, Payments) align to 1:1:1 traceability; Change Orders modeled as BH with BT children.
- Inventory Zero‚ÄëLoss sub‚Äëmodule includes controls (DistributedLock, TransactionChain) for custody integrity.
- Lifecycle/audit baseline present in sampled Prisma (Estimating) and affirmed by module docs (Projects/Change Orders).

Items to Watch / Recommendations:

- AuditLog classification: Listed as [Tenant] under Platform. This is fine for RLS; if a cross‚Äëtenant/system‚Äëwide view is needed, consider an additional `SystemAuditLog [Global]` or ETL to analytics.
- Observability logs: `SystemLog [Tenant]` keeps RLS intact; for platform‚Äëwide ops, mirror summaries to a global or external log sink.
- Partial unique constraints: Adopt partial (deletedAt IS NULL) uniques where soft‚Äëdelete is supported (e.g., document numbers) ‚Äî some are noted as TODO in estimating models.
- OCC/version: Ensure `version` is uniformly present across BT/BH models and enforced in write APIs.
- Composite FK/indices: Continue enforcing `[tenantId, fk] ‚Üí [tenantId, id]` and add BRIN on major time‚Äëseries (TimesheetEntry, Message, DomainEvent).
- Signature requirements: For inventory and other security‚Äëcritical flows, verify dual‚Äësignature relations exist in concrete Prisma models (the patterns are specified; ensure implemented during schema expansion).

Conclusion: The model inventory is coherent, enterprise‚Äëgrade, and aligned with the platform‚Äôs anti‚Äëfraud and compliance goals. Minor enhancements above will further harden cross‚Äëtenant observability and soft‚Äëdelete uniqueness.

## TODOs / Watchlist

- Partial uniques: adopt `where deletedAt IS NULL` on external numbers once all soft deletes are implemented (e.g., Estimates, Invoices).
- Uniform OCC: ensure `version` is present and enforced across all BT/BH models in write paths.
- Dual‚Äësignature enforcement: verify explicit relations for inventory ASSIGN/TRANSFER/RETURN in Prisma schema as models are expanded.
- BRIN coverage: confirm BRIN indexing on high‚Äëvolume time‚Äëseries (TimesheetEntry, DomainEvent, Message).
- Cross‚Äëtenant audit view: consider a global audit aggregation or ETL for platform‚Äëwide ops while retaining tenant‚Äëscoped `AuditLog` for RLS.
