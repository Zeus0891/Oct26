-- ============================================================================
-- PROJECT_MANAGER RLS POLICIES - Multi-Tenant Security Implementation
-- Auto-generated from RBAC.schema.v7.yml PROJECT_MANAGER permissions
-- Pattern: IDEMPOTENT PL/pgSQL - Safe for production deployment
-- Date: 2025-10-05
-- ============================================================================
--
-- ‚ú® IDEMPOTENT PATTERN: Uses pg_policies system table to check existence
-- üöÄ PRODUCTION-READY: Safe for Neon, Supabase, and repeated deployments
-- üîí SECURITY: app.is_project_manager() + tenant isolation + soft delete awareness
-- üìã CONDITIONAL: TenantSettings toggles documented at bottom
-- üåç GLOBAL TABLES EXCLUDED: 34 tables without tenantId automatically skipped
--
-- PROJECT_MANAGER Role Check Function:
-- Uses app.is_project_manager() helper from 004_helpers.sql
