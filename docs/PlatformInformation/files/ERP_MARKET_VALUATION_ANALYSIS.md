## 3. VALUATION METHODOLOGY

### 3.1 Multiple Valuation Approaches

We employ five complementary valuation methodologies to triangulate fair market value:

#### 3.1.1 Revenue Multiple Method

**Formula**: Valuation = ARR × Revenue Multiple

**Revenue Multiples by Stage**:
| Stage | ARR Growth | Multiple Range | Rationale |
|-------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Pre-Revenue / MVP | N/A | 0.5-2x of development cost | Cost-based |
| Early Revenue (<$1M ARR) | 100%+ | 8-15x ARR | High growth potential |
| Growth Stage ($1M-$10M ARR) | 50-100% | 10-20x ARR | Proven PMF |
| Scale Stage ($10M-$50M ARR) | 30-50% | 8-15x ARR | Mature growth |
| Mature ($50M+ ARR) | 15-30% | 5-10x ARR | Market position |

**Industry Benchmarks** (SaaS ERP Companies):
- High-growth (>60% YoY): 15-30x ARR
- Medium-growth (30-60% YoY): 10-15x ARR
- Stable-growth (<30% YoY): 5-10x ARR

#### 3.1.2 Comparable Company Analysis

**Public Company Comparables** (as of Q3 2025):

| Company | Revenue | Market Cap | Revenue Multiple | Growth Rate |
|---------|---------|------------|------------------|-------------|
| Workday | $7.2B | $62B | 8.6x | 18% |
| ServiceNow | $9.8B | $145B | 14.8x | 24% |
| Salesforce | $31.4B | $260B | 8.3x | 11% |
| SAP | $8.3B (ERP) | $140B | 16.8x | 7% |
| Oracle NetSuite | $2.1B | $32B (est.) | 15.2x | 22% |

**Median Multiple**: 14.8x revenue
**Mean Multiple**: 12.7x revenue

**Private Company Comparables** (Recent Acquisitions):

| Company | Acquisition Price | Revenue | Multiple | Acquirer |
|---------|------------------|---------|----------|----------|
| Acumatica (est.) | $2.0B | $200M | 10.0x | EQT Partners |
| FinancialForce | $1.2B | $120M | 10.0x | Certinia |
| Rootstock | $850M | $65M | 13.1x | Accel-KKR |
| Procore | IPO at $9B | $400M | 22.5x | Public Markets |

**Median Multiple**: 11.5x revenue for acquisitions
**Mean Multiple**: 13.9x revenue

#### 3.1.3 Development Cost Approach

**Total Development Cost Estimation**:

| Component | Developer-Months | Cost per Month | Total Cost |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|------------|
| Core Infrastructure | 6 | $15,000 | $90,000 |
| Security & RLS | 6 | $18,000 | $108,000 |
| Shared Components | 8 | $15,000 | $120,000 |
| 32 Business Modules | 120 | $15,000 | $1,800,000 |
| Testing & QA | 20 | $12,000 | $240,000 |
| Documentation | 8 | $10,000 | $80,000 |
| DevOps & Infrastructure | 12 | $16,000 | $192,000 |
| **Total Development** | **180** | | **$2,630,000** |

**Multiplier for Market Value**: 2.5x - 4x development cost
**Cost-Based Valuation Range**: $6.6M - $10.5M (baseline for MVP)

#### 3.1.4 Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

**5-Year Cash Flow Projection** (Conservative Scenario):

| Year | Revenue | COGS | Operating Expenses | EBITDA | Cash Flow |
|------|---------|------|-------------------|--------|-----------|
| Y1 | $500K | $150K | $2.5M | -$2.15M | -$2.0M |
| Y2 | $2.5M | $750K | $4.5M | -$2.75M | -$2.5M |
| Y3 | $10M | $3M | $8M | -$1M | -$800K |
| Y4 | $25M | $7.5M | $14M | $3.5M | $3.2M |
| Y5 | $50M | $15M | $22M | $13M | $12M |

**Terminal Value** (Year 5): $50M revenue × 10x multiple = $500M
**Discount Rate**: 25% (early-stage SaaS)
**NPV**: ~$140M
**Current Value (Year 0)**: $140M / (1.25)^2.5 = **$72M** (optimistic scenario)

#### 3.1.5 Venture Capital Method

**Target Exit Value** (Year 5): $300M - $500M (strategic acquisition)
**Target Investor Return**: 10x - 15x
**Post-Money Valuation** (Series A): $20M - $50M
**Pre-Money Valuation**: $17M - $42M (after $3M-$8M raise)

**VC Typical Ownership Targets**:
- Seed (current stage): 15-25% for $1M-$3M
- Series A: 20-30% for $5M-$15M
- Series B: 15-25% for $15M-$40M
